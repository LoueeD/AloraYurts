      Alora yurts, originally as York Yurts in the UK and from 2010 
      to the warmer climate of Andalusia in Southern Spain.
      <br><br>
      For the past few years we have set up wonderfully relaxing environments 
      in magical places in the Region of Andalucia to run our unique, and 
      incredibly popular Yurt experience hideaways.

      After a few days in this magical setting with stunning surrounding 
      countryside and wildlife, meals to die for, unlimited cuddles from 
      adoring, lovable and low maintenance rescue dog’s visitors can’t avoid 
      leaving anything other than totally relaxed and recharged.

      We have relocated to what we believe to be a very special site. 
      Formerly a yoga retreat this venue offers a true retreat experience.

      Set within 250 acres of un spoilt land high in the hills where 
      avocados, oranges, lemons, figs and nuts grow all around you really are 
      driving over lemons to get to this place.

      Once you arrive you will be hard pushed to leave until it’s time to go home. 
      <br><br>
      This site is extremely spacious with many areas to escape if you are 
      looking for some time for quiet contemplation. 
      <br><br>
      Beautiful gardens, pool, palm trees, hammocks and shaded terraces 
      are just some of what you can expect to find.
